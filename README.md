==================

Inventory system for small shops. pile everything in a box and write it down in this little database, then look for it with a command-line tool. Remember: if you can't find it, you don't really have it!

Originally written in bash using a single text file per box, then refactored to python using a single csv, and now I'm toying with sqlite3.
